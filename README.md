# Filiberto Oceguera – Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website. I designed it to share a bit about who I am, what I’ve worked on, and what I’m learning as I grow as a developer. The theme is inspired by western and Fallout New Vegas elements, hopefully its subtle enough to blend into a clean layout, but noticeable to anyone who recognizes it.

## Live Site

https://cptwickie.github.io/Portfolio/

## Overview

The site includes the following sections:

- **Home** – Short intro and visual identity
- **About** – My background, interests, and a link to my resume
- **Projects** – A breakdown of three different projects, including a video demo
- **Skills** – Frontend, backend, and tools I’ve worked with
- **Contact** – A working form using Formspree

## Tools Used

This site is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks like React were used yet. I used Git for version control and GitHub for hosting.

## How to Run the Project

If you want to run this site locally:

1. Clone this repository:

2. Open the folder and launch `index.html` in a browser

You can also use Live Server in VS Code if you want things to reload automatically.

## Contact Form

The contact form uses Formspree to send submissions to my email. I included a basic honeypot to prevent spam.

## Notes

This project was made for a class assignment. Screenshots of each page and the live GitHub Pages link are included in the project submission document.
